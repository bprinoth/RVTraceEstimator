# Radial Velocity (RV) Trace Estimator

RVTraceEstimator allows you to calculate the radial velocity extents of your planet, star, tellurics and RM for planning your transit (and also emission curves (without RM of course)). 

It allows you to pick you to query the NASA Exoplanet Archive for the orbital, planetary and stellar parameters and pick a date for your observation.
